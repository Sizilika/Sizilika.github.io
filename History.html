                <h1>The History They Made</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="scroll-animation">
                <h1>Kris Antoni Hadiputra and Sudarmin Then originally studied at Murdoch University, and in 2007 they teamed up on campus to do a joint project, and named their team "Toge". After graduating in 2008, the two went to work for a game company, and when they discovered that there was a $1,000 Flash game development competition, the two planned to participate in the competition to earn pocket money. Although neither of them won the competition, during the competition, the two searched for more market information about Flash games, decided to quit their jobs to develop Flash games, and founded the game development company Toge Productions on January 20, 2009. They took the name "Toge" from the name "bean sprouts", which they believe that great success can start from small beginnings, and hope that in the future, their company will grow as fast as sprouts and become highly adaptable.</h1>

            <div class="scroll-animation">
                <h1>In the early days of 2009, they only had 2 computers and 2,000 dollars, Kris' father did not support his son's choice, Kris could only live in Sudarmin's garage temporarily, and both of them could only eat cheap instant noodles. The situation got better, the company started making profits in the first year of its existence, and they also brought former classmates to join Toge Productions. Their game, Infectonator, had over 7 million players in 2013, and was critically acclaimed on Newgrounds' Flash platform, and they have continued to improve the game ever since. The high popularity of the Infectonator series often receives daily and weekly referrals from Flash gaming platforms Newgrounds and Kongregate, and receives cash prizes from Kongregate. At the same time, Flash Game License, a networking site that allows Flash game developers and publishers to communicate, also allowed Toge Productions to receive initial development funding from the publisher.</h1>

            <div class ="scroll-animation">
                <h1>In 2010, thanks to the success of Infectonator and support from publisher Mochi Games, they moved the company to Jakarta and developed Planetary Conflict, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Although Planetary Conflict received praise, the game's operating costs were too high to generate sufficient profits. The development team of only 4 people at the time also realized that it was not big enough to run such a game. Since then, Toge Productions has set its own development direction, namely developing deep and interesting single-player games.</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="scroll-animation">
                <h1>In 2012, after Steve Jobs' ban on Flash on the iPhone, Adobe announced its withdrawal from the Android platform. As the news shrank the market for Flash games, Toge Productions began exploring new directions, anchoring their games to mobile devices, and in 2013, they ventured into Steam Greenlight to try releasing games on Steam. In 2014, Toge Productions discovered that their Infectonator: Survivor had been copied by mainland Chinese game developers and released to the App Store, where they were copied and removed after filing a complaint.</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="scroll-animation">
                <h1>In January 2017, Toge Productions invested in Mojiken, a game development group in Indonesia. In February, Toge Productions received a strategic investment from Discovery Nusantara Capital, which Kris said the company would use to develop Indonesian video games and launch them on the world market. In May, Toge Productions announced that it was establishing an indie video game publisher and planned to support locally produced games. In December, Toge Productions launched Game Jams internally, and a Coffee Talk prototype, Project Green Tea Latte, which became a major development project for the company over the next two years.</h1>

            <div class="scroll-animation">
                <h1>In June 2021, Toge Productions established the Toge Game Fund Initiative to support indie video game developers. The plan is to focus on game developers in Southeast Asia, and could receive up to $100,000 in funding.</h1>
